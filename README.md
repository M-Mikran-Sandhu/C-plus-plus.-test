## Overview

This repository contains a collection of simple C++ programs designed for basic learning and practice. It serves as a practical resource for beginners who are starting their journey in C++ programming. The programs demonstrate fundamental concepts and provide hands-on examples that help reinforce programming principles.

## Contents

The repository includes various C++ programs covering different aspects of programming:

### Basic Programs
- Simple function demonstrations
- Input/output operations
- Variable declarations and manipulations
- Basic arithmetic operations

### Intermediate Concepts
- Function implementations
- Array manipulations
- Class definitions and usage
- Operator overloading examples

### Practical Applications
- ATM System simulation with password protection
- Various task-based programs demonstrating specific programming concepts

## Features

- **Educational Focus**: All programs are designed with learning in mind, making them ideal for beginners.
- **Practical Examples**: Real-world applications like the ATM system provide context for programming concepts.
- **Progressive Complexity**: Programs range from simple to more complex, allowing for gradual learning.
- **Well-Commented Code**: Comments help explain the purpose and functionality of different code sections.
- **Variety of Concepts**: Covers multiple C++ programming concepts in one repository.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run these programs, you'll need:
- A C++ compiler (like g++, Visual C++, or Clang)
- Basic understanding of command-line operations or an IDE that supports C++

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/M-Mikran-Sandhu/C-plus-plus.-test.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```
   cd C-plus-plus.-test
   ```

### Compilation and Execution

To compile a C++ program, use your preferred C++ compiler. For example, with g++:

```
g++ -o program_name program_name.cpp
```

To run the compiled program:

```
./program_name
```

## Program Descriptions

### ATM SYSTEM.cpp
A simulation of an ATM interface that includes:
- Password protection
- Options to withdraw money or check balance
- Balance validation for withdrawals

### === overloding.cpp
Demonstrates class implementation and array manipulation with:
- Array class definition
- Input and display methods
- Array initialization and element access

### Name Function.cpp
A simple program showing function implementation:
- Outputs a predefined name
- Demonstrates basic function calling

### Other Programs
The repository contains numerous other programs that cover various aspects of C++ programming, from basic syntax to more complex implementations.

## Learning Path

For beginners, it's recommended to start with simpler programs like:
1. Name Function.cpp
2. 1st sum.cpp
3. Question 1.cpp

Then progress to more complex examples like:
1. === overloding.cpp
2. ATM SYSTEM.cpp
3. Task-based programs (TASK 1.cpp, TASK 2.cpp, etc.)
